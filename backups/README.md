# Backup Conventions

This project uses a hybrid backup approach:
- /daily: Date-stamped backups (YYYY-MM-DD)
- /sessions: Development session backups (YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM)

Note: This is a local development project with:
- Virtual environment (./venv)
- GitHub version control
- Local development -> Cloud deployment workflow
